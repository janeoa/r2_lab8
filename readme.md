I've tried different parameters with different amont of steps and iterations. Each step took round 2-3 seconds so 100 step 50 iteration training took about 2.5h to run. But I didn't know that it stores output only on succesfull exit, so I lost my progress 1.5h in.

I've tried playing around with alpha sigma and gamma and realized that most of them doesn't decrease the time of the step anyway, but does affect how fast arm reaches the endpoint by time. So I tweaked around and had three results

but all of them were poor and I spend to much time on training and got tired from running the simulations
